It inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and to suppress the PGE2 production by inflammatory cells, by inhibiting IL-Beta & TNF in the inflammatory cells (Intracellular Action).\n 2. It blocks degeneration and stimulates synthesis of extra cellular matrix of cartilages by inhibiting the action of different cytokines.\n 3. Drug and its metabolites inhibit IL-6 production by human chondrocytes. This leads to inhibition of increase of inflammatory cells in synovial tissue, inhibition of IL-1 amplification, inhibition of increased MMP synthesis and thus ensuring proteoglycan production.\n 4. It inhibits IL-1 and TNF production by human chondrocytes, inflammatory cells and synovial cells and therefore blocks suppression of GAG and collagen synthesis and stimulates growth factors mediated synthesis of GAG and collagen.\n 5. 4`-hydroxyaceclofenac a metabolite of aceclofenac inhibits pro MMP1 and pro MMP3 produced by synovial cells (Rheumatoid Synovial Cells) in serum and in synovial fluid and thus inhibits progressive joint destruction by MMPs.\n 6.

It increases natriuresis, kaliuresis and diuresis. It decreases Ca2+ excretion and increases Mg2+excretion. It also has minor carbonic anhydrase inhibitory action. It also causes direct arteriolar vasodilatation and decreases total peripheral resistance.

I have been diagnosed with heart failure and doctor has prescribed me Ramod. Why?\n Ramod belongs to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor group of drugs. It relaxes and widens the blood vessels, making it easier for the blood to pass through the vessels. As a result of this, the heart does not have to work more to push the blood. Since the workload on the heart is reduced, it is beneficial in heart failure. Additionally, it is also used to lower blood pressure and prevent stroke.\n \n Q. Can Ramod increase potassium levels? If yes, what should be done?\n Ramod may increase potassium levels in the blood, especially if you have uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, kidney problems and dehydration. Potassium levels may also increase in patients using potassium salts or medicines which increase potassium levels or are aged more than 70 years of age. If you have any of these conditions and are using Ramod, you need to be careful and get regular blood tests done to monitor potassium levels.\n \n Q. When can I expect my blood pressure to be normal after starting Ramod?\n Ramod takes a few hours to reduce high blood pressure but since there are no symptoms, you will not notice any difference. It takes a few weeks for the blood pressure to get fully controlled. Do not stop taking the medicine, and keep taking it even if you feel better or if your blood pressure is normalised.\n \n Q. Ever since I started taking Ramod, I noticed that I have developed dry cough which is very irritating and is not relieved by any medicine. Why is it?\n Ramod commonly is responsible for dry cough which is persistent and is not relieved by any medicine. Talk to your doctor if it bothers you or you have trouble sleeping, as another medicine may be better. Even if you stop taking Ramod, the cough may take a few days to a month to go away.\n \n Q. I accidentally took 25 mg Ramod tablet instead of one 5 mg. Will it have any harmful effects?\n Yes, you may feel lightheaded, dizzy, your pulse will be slow and you may even faint. You should take the help of a relative or friend for emergency or seek immediate medical support.\n \n Q. Will there be any problem if I am taking Ramod and I have a surgery scheduled in a week?\n Inform your doctor that you are taking Ramod. Ramod can reduce your blood pressure when it is used with a general anesthetic. Your doctor may advise you to stop taking it 24 hours before surgery.\n \n Q. Can Ramod affect my fertility?\n There is no evidence that Ramod has any effect on fertility in both men and women. However, if you are planning to get pregnant, talk to your doctor first because Ramod is not recommended in pregnancy.\n \n Q. I have diabetes. Does Ramod have any effect on blood sugar levels?\n Yes, Ramod may have some effect on antidiabetic medicines and insulin and may lower your blood glucose levels. Therefore, you need to check your blood glucose levels regularly,\n \n Q. I have been using Ramod for blood pressure since sometime, but now I have noticed that I often have a sore throat along with fever. I want to stop Ramod and see if this goes, can I stop Ramod?\n No, you should not stop Ramod suddenly as this may cause a sudden increase in your blood pressure which may be harmful for you. In addition to this, Ramod can very rarely decrease your white blood cell count which are important to fight infections in your body. Consult your doctor and get a blood test done. If your white cell count is decreased, then it could be due to Ramod. Ask your doctor for an alternative medicine for blood pressure. You can continue taking Ramod if your investigations are normal.\n \n Q. Is it safe to take Ramod for a long time?\n Yes, Ramod is safe and works best if taken for a long time. But, taking Ramod for a long time can sometimes cause your kidneys to not work as well as they should. To keep a track of this, your doctor will get regular blood tests done and check how well your kidneys are working."},

Carry a sugar source with you for immediate relief.\n Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any deep or rapid breathing, persistent nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain as Metformin may cause a rare but serious condition called lactic acidosis, which is an excess of lactic acid in the blood.\n Vitamin B12 deficiency and symptoms of anemia like fatigue, pale skin, shortness of breath or headache may occur. Notify your doctor if you experience any of these as you may require supplements.\n Your doctor will monitor your blood sugar levels and kidney functions regularly while taking this medication.","How to Use":"Glycomet 1gm Tablet SR (15'S) is to be taken with food.","FAQs":"Q. What does Metformin do exactly?\n  People with type 2 diabetes are not able to make enough insulin or respond normally to the insulin made by their bodies. When this happens, the concentration of sugar/glucose increases in the blood. Metformin acts in several ways to reduce the increased levels of sugar in blood. Metformin decreases the glucose production from the liver, decreases absorption of glucose from the intestine after taking food, and improves the sensitivity of the body organs and muscles to insulin. This helps improve the uptake of glucose from the blood. It helps your body respond better to the insulin it makes naturally.\n \n Q. Does Metformin cause weight loss?\n  Yes, Metformin has been shown to reduce weight in people who are sensitive or resistant to insulin, overweight, or obese. The use of Metformin may cause modest weight loss in overweight and obese individuals who are at risk for diabetes. But, do not start taking this medicine for weight loss. \n \n Q. What are the benefits of taking Metformin?\n Metformin is one of the first medicines that is given to patients with high blood sugar levels. It helps control the blood sugar. It promotes the body's response to the insulin made by the pancreas, decreases the amount of sugar made by the liver, and decreases the amount of sugar absorbed by the intestines. Unlike other oral antidiabetic medicines, Metformin when taken alone rarely cause low blood sugar as it prevents the pancreas from secreting more insulin. In addition to being a great blood sugar lowering medicine, it also helps control weight gain.\n \n Q. Can Metformin make you sleepy?\n Metformin usually does not cause sleepiness and is well tolerated. However, the use of Metformin may rarely cause sleep disorders and insomnia. Sleepiness may be due to a very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your kidneys are not working properly. Therefore, you must immediately contact your doctor if you feel sleepy or tired while taking Metformin. \n \n Q. How to take Metformin?\n  Take Metformin with or after a meal. Do not crush or chew the tablets and swallow it with a glass of water. If your doctor has prescribed one tablet a day, take it in the morning with breakfast. If two tablets a day, then take one in the morning and other in evening with dinner. If you take three doses a day, apart from morning and evening take it with lunch. Taking Metformin with meals will reduce its digestive problems like indigestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, bellyache and loss of appetite."}
